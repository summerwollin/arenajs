# ArenaJS
ArenaJS is a multiplayer first person shooter made using [OpenArena](http://www.openarena.ws/) game assets, WebGl for in-browser 3D graphics, WebRTC for peer to peer connections, and is built off of [TojiCode's](http://blog.tojicode.com/) open source rendering logic. Players can take on up to three opponents in this last one standing game play.
