Quake 3 Resources
=================

This folder is where you should extract the resources from your own copy of Quake 3
to be able to load the maps. And yes, you have to provide your own resources, I'm
not going to redistribute id's property. (This works just fine with the Quake 3 demo
PAKs, though, if you can dig one of them up!)

Resource preparation
--------------------

As much as I tried to avoid it, there are some changes that you will need to make to
the game resources before they can be loaded: 

 * Any texture files that you need must be converted to PNGs. 
 * You must make sure that all textures dimensions are a power of 2 (64, 128, 256, 1024, etc)
